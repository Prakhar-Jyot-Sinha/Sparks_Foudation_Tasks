# COMPLETION OF TASK 3
## TASK 3 : To build an Unsupervised model on Iris Dataset 

- README is our documentation file
- Added Iris Prediction-Kmeans.ipynb jupiter notebook - this is my model
- Added iris csv file (data file) 

- Here I have used `KMeans` algorithm for clusterring our data 
- I have taken 3 centriods as suggested by my Elbow method and then I have normalised the data before building model as it provides bettter results
- Checked my accuracy with silhouette score
